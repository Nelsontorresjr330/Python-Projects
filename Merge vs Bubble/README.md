## Merge vs Bubble Sort

This python program will run two sorting algorithms (bubble & merge sort) after asking the user for a list to sort
or how many numbers to randomly generate. Once completed, the console displays the elapsed time for each sort.
By removing a few comments in the code the program will also print the list results.
